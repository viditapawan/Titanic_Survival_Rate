# Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains code and resources for predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning. The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, class, and fare. The project follows a standard machine learning pipeline including data exploration, data cleaning, survival analysis, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, feature importance analysis, and visualization.

## Repository Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains the dataset files.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and visualization.
- **`src/`**: Source code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and feature importance analysis.
- **`README.md`**: This file, containing an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

## Data Exploration

Begin by exploring the dataset's basic statistics and visualizing distributions of key features like age and fare.

## Data Cleaning

Handle missing values, convert categorical variables into numerical format, and address outliers if necessary.

## Survival Analysis

Calculate the overall survival rate and explore survival rates by gender, class, and age group.

## Feature Engineering

Create new features like 'FamilySize' and extract titles from passenger names to enhance model performance.

## Model Building

Choose a machine learning algorithm and train it on the data, aiming to predict passenger survival.

## Model Evaluation

Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

Fine-tune model hyperparameters to optimize predictive accuracy.

## Cross-Validation

Ensure the model's generalizability by using cross-validation techniques.

## Feature Importance

Identify which features have the most significant impact on survival prediction.

## Visualization and Interpretation

Create visualizations to explore relationships between variables and summarize key findings to gain insights into factors influencing passenger survival.
